                        BattletechMUX Map Library
                             (btmux_maplib)

What is it?
-----------
btmux_maplib is a set of utility classes and functions for parsing, 
manipulating, and visualizing BattletechMUX .map files. 

Why?
----
As of the time of this module's writing, there are no publicly available
BTMux map utilities in Python. This package seeks to remedy that.

Requirements
------------
This package requires PIL (it's only been tested on 1.1.6) and Python 2.5
(although it wouldn't be too hard to get it running on 2.4 if you wanted to).

Installation
------------
As root/admin on your machine:
  python setup.py install
  
Documentation
-------------
As of right now, the only documentation are the examples in the examples
directory. There's a whole lot going on right now, and not much time for
cleanly documenting this stuff. However, the source code is very well
commented.

Future Goals
------------
See TODO.txt.

Support
